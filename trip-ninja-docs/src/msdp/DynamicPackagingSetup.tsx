        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          Multi-Stop Dynamic Packaging (MSDP) provides an alternative to traditional static packaging.
          It allows users to build packages as they go. While users search for multi-destination flights,
          MSDP will find eligible hotels with which to bundle.
        </p>
        <p>Please refer to the following diagram for the general MSDP flow.</p>
