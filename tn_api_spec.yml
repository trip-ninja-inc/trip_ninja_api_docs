    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Trip Ninja uses a REST API with requests and responses in JSON format. For development and testing, the pre-production servers
    are to be used. Once ready for live use, access to the production servers will be provided. All search endpoints have both production
    and pre-production endpoints - these correspond to the GDS’s production and pre-production services, and can be used as desired.<br  />
    <h2>Trip Ninja API URLs</h2>
    Production: http://trip-ninja-api.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

    Pre-Production: http://trip-ninja-api-preprod.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

    For security, Trip Ninja’s servers are only accessible from whitelisted IPs. Please contact your account manager to whitelist IPs you
    will be using.

    Before you start ensure that:<br  />
        - IP addresses have been provided to be whitelisted for our servers.<br  />
        - PCC / OfficeID emulation via Trip Ninja’s PCC/OfficeID has been set up.<br  />
        - API username and password have been provided by Trip Ninja.<br  />

    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    The following diagram shows the typical data flow of API calls to Trip Ninja for a FareStructure integration with both a partner website
    and metasearch as sources.

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    Trip Ninja uses Basic Authentication standards. Simply encode your username and password string using base64 and pass it in the
    authorization headers. See the python example below on how this is done. In the example, the payload and API endpoint url are not
    shown.

    Python Example:

    <pre>
    import base64
    auth = base64.b64encode("USERNAME:PASSWORD")
    headers = {
        'authorization': "Basic "+ auth,
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    </pre>

              The FareStructure product returns the set of best GDS responses that create the specified route. It finds the best fare structure via
              split ticketing and does not reorder the destinations. Each of the returned segments must be ticketed in its own PNR.

                each destination, any destinations that must be visited first or last, and search for the best route. The response contains the best
                route found that satisfies their input parameters.

                Higher values result in:

                    1) faster queries as more data is available for re-use

                    2) lower look-to-book ratios from the GDS perspective which may lower costs

                    3) less accurate pricing data which may cause issues in AirPriceReq when ticketing.

                This parameter helps set the value of a passenger’s time, in
                terms of the currency selected. It is used to trade off flight
                prices versus flight durations. The parameter is in units of
                [currency]/hour. Flight durations are calculated as the difference
                in minutes from the arrival time of the last flight in a leg to
                the departure time of the first flight in the leg.

                True Cost of Flight = [Flight Price] * [time_value/60] * [Flight Duration]

                The itinerary which provides the lowest True Cost of Flight is
                what is returned in the response. If you provide a time_value
                of 0 or do not provide the parameter, it will sort by price.

                    This parameter helps set the value of a passenger’s time, in
                    terms of the currency selected. It is used to trade off flight
                    prices versus flight durations. The parameter is in units of
                    [currency]/hour. Flight durations are calculated as the difference
                    in minutes from the arrival time of the last flight in a leg to
                    the departure time of the first flight in the leg.
