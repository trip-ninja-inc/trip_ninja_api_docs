    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Trip Ninja uses a REST API with requests and responses in JSON format. For development and testing, the pre-production servers
    are to be used. Once ready for live use, access to the production servers will be provided. All search endpoints have both production
    and pre-production endpoints - these correspond to the GDS’s production and pre-production services, and can be used as desired.<br  />
    <h2>Trip Ninja API URLs</h2>

    Pre-Production: http://trip-ninja-api-preprod.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

    For security, Trip Ninja’s servers are only accessible from whitelisted IPs. Please contact your account manager to whitelist IPs you
    will be using.

    Before you start ensure that:<br  />
        - IP addresses have been provided to be whitelisted for our servers.<br  />
        - PCC / OfficeID emulation via Trip Ninja’s PCC/OfficeID has been set up.<br  />
        - API username and password have been provided by Trip Ninja.<br  />

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    Trip Ninja uses Basic Authentication standards. Simply encode your username and password string using base64 and pass it in the
    authorization headers. See the python example below on how this is done. In the example, the payload and API endpoint url are not
    shown.

    Python Example:

    <pre>
    import base64
    auth = base64.b64encode("USERNAME:PASSWORD")
    headers = {
        'authorization': "Basic "+ auth,
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    </pre>
