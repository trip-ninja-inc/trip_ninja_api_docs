        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Trip Ninja uses a REST API with requests and responses in JSON format. For development and testing, the pre-production servers
        are to be used. Once ready for live use, access to the production servers will be provided. <br  />
        <h2>Trip Ninja API URLs</h2>
        
        Pre-Production: https://preprodapi.tripninja.io
        
        For security, Trip Ninja’s servers are only accessible from whitelisted IPs. Please contact your account manager to whitelist IPs you
        will be using.
        
        Before you start ensure that:<br  />
            - IP addresses have been provided to be whitelisted for our servers.<br  />
            - API username and password have been provided by Trip Ninja.<br  />
        
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        The following diagram shows the typical data flow of API calls to Trip Ninja for a typical OTA integration using our new core non-emulation architecture.

        <h2>Authentication</h2>
        Trip Ninja uses Basic Authentication standards. Simply encode your username and password string using base64 and pass it in the
        authorization headers. See the python example below on how this is done. In the example, the payload and API endpoint url are not
        shown.
        
        Python Example:
        
        <pre>
        import base64
        auth = base64.b64encode("USERNAME:PASSWORD")
        headers = {
            'authorization': "Basic "+ auth,
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
        </pre>

                This endpoint carries out FareStructure and if applicable Virtual Interlining logic to determine the optimal searches predicted to provide the best flight search results. The response contains a list of searches to be done by the OTA, which are then passed in the next
                endpoint (generate-solutions) to get the results.
